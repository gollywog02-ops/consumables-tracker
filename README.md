# Consumables Tracker – Next.js Starter

This is a minimal App Router Next.js project so you can deploy and get a URL fast.

## Deploy on Vercel (no terminal needed)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (name it `consumables-tracker`).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to that repo.
3. In Vercel: New Project → Import the repo → Deploy.
4. Open the URL Vercel gives you. You should see “Deployment OK ✅”.

## Local (optional)
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Visit http://localhost:3000

## Next steps
We’ll replace this starter with the real app code from the spec.
